## üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction App
This Streamlit app demonstrates how machine learning works, focusing on simple classification algorithms for predicting wine quality and colour. Users can experiment with data, adjust parameters, and select different models to observe how these changes affect the model's performance.

## Features
Predict wine quality or colour using machine learning models
Choose from different models: Random Forest, XGBoost, or Decision Tree
Adjust model parameters and hyperparameters
Visualise model performance metrics and feature importance
Interactive user input for wine characteristics
Display of ROC curves for model evaluation

## How to Use
Select what to predict: Quality or Colour
Choose a machine learning model
Adjust test size and model hyperparameters
Input custom wine characteristics or use default values
View model performance metrics, feature importance, and ROC curves

## Dataset
The app uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository wine dataset, which includes various chemical components of wines along with their quality ratings and colours.
Model Performance Metrics
The app displays the following performance metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score

## Visualisations
